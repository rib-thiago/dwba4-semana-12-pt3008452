    <h3><a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1905/nov/18.htm" target="_blank">The Denouement is At
        Hand</a></h3>
    <blockquote>
      The struggle is approaching its denouement, the answer to the question whether actual power is to remain with the
      tsar's
      government. As for recognition of the revolution, it has now been generally recognised. It was recognised quite
      long ago
      by Mr. Struve and the Osvobozhdeniye gentry. It is now recognised by Mr. Witte and by Nicholas Romanov.
      <q>I promise you anything you wish</q>, says the tsar, <q>only let me retain power, let me fulfil my own
        promises</q>.
      That is the gist of the tsar's Manifesto, and it obviously had to spark off a determined struggle.
      <q>I grant you everything except power</q>, tsarism declares. <strong>Everything is illusory except
        power</strong>,
      the revolutionary people reply.
    </blockquote>
